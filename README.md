## Introduction

The CSSI web portal is a web application that allows users to access LoRa device
data. This data can be visualized through the built-in data visualization functionality, or
exported to a file to be analyzed and/or visualized with external tools and methods.
LoRa devices will belong to specific “applications,” which have their own principle
investigators assigned to them. The principle investigators can control data access
permissions to researchers/operators within the application, or grant permission to
users outside of the application. Enthusiast users will have their own application with
full control of their own data and LoRa devices. The goal of this web portal is to act as
a tool for research and a catalyst to the expansion of LoRa technology infrastructure.
